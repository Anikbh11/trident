Trident
=======

Trident is a python-based package extending yt for generating synthetic
absorption-line spectra of hydrodynamical datasets.  For more information
about Trident and yt, please visit the websites or look at the code repository:

Installation
------------

The Trident source is most easily installed using pip.  But you can only
do this once you've installed yt and its dependencies.  If you already have
the dev version of yt installed, then skip to step 2.  


Step 1: Install yt  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several methods for doing this all discussed in detail in the yt 
docs here: http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/installing.html
Note that Trident currently requires the development branch of yt to work
properly.

If you're just starting out, we recommend the anaconda method as the least
work for new users to get yt installed as described here (be sure to get 
the development version of yt):
http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/installing.html#installing-yt-using-anaconda


Step 2: Install Trident
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install Trident using pip::

    $ pip install trident


Step 3: Get Ionization Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to calculate the ionization fractions for various ions from 
density, temperature, metallicity, and redshift fields, you will need 
an ionization table data file.  The first time you import Trident, it will 
attempt to automatically download this file for you with some interactive 
prompts::

    $ python
    >>> import trident

Alternatively, you can acquire it manually by downloading/unzipping one of the 
files at http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance .  You can store this
file wherever you desire, just assure the config file in your $HOME/.trident
directory points to it.  The contents of $HOME/.trident/config should be:

[Trident]
ion_table_dir = /Users/chummels/.trident
ion_table_file = hm2012_lr.h5

Step 4: Science!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You're now ready to use Trident.  Please refer to the documentation for how
to use it with your data or with one of our sample datasets.
