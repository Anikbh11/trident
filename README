Trident is a python-based package extending yt for generating synthetic
absorption-line spectra of hydrodynamical datasets.  For more information
about Trident and yt, please visit the websites or look at the code repository:

Trident is most easily installed using pip:

$ pip install trident

In order to identify ionization fractions for various ions, a large table
file must be present.  This file can either be downloaded manually, or 
it will be downloaded automatically with prompts to the user the first time 
Trident is imported.

To download the file manually, grab one of the following files and place 
it in your $HOME/.trident directory:

High-Res (1.6GB)

$ wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_hr.h5 

Low-Res (205MB)

$ wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_lr.h5

The best results are achieved using the high-resolution data 
file (1.6GB), but the low-resolution data is also acceptable (205MB).
