Trident is a python-based package extending yt for generating synthetic
observations of hydrodynamical datasets.

Please visit the Trident and yt websites for more information:

http://trident-project.org

http://yt-project.org


To install Trident, please make sure yt is installed first.  Then download the
Trident repository at: http://bitbucket.org/trident-project/trident .  If you
have mercurial installed, you can do this with:

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/trident-project/trident

$ cd trident

$ python setup.py develop


In addition, you will need a data file for running Trident.  Get 
one of the following files and put it in the trident/data/ion_balance/ 
directory.  The best results are achieved using the high-resolution data 
file (1.6GB), but the low-resolution data is also acceptable (205MB).

High-Res (1.6GB)

$ cd <path/to/trident/repo>

$ wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_hr.h5 data/ion_balance

Low-Res (205MB)

$ wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_lr.h5 data/ion_balance


Now you should be ready to go.  To test your installation, you can go into
the examples directory and run the working_script.py file.  You will require
the enzo_cosmology_plus yt public dataset in order for this example to work.
To get it and test it, run:

$ wget http://yt-project.org/data/enzo_cosmology_plus.tar.gz .

$ tar -zxvf enzo_cosmology_plus.tar.gz

$ cp <path/to/trident/repo>/examples/working_script.py enzo_cosmology_plus

$ cd enzo_cosmology_plus

$ python working_script.py
