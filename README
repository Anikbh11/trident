Trident is a python-based package extending yt for generating synthetic
observations of hydrodynamical datasets.

Please visit the Trident and yt websites for more information:
http://trident-project.org
http://yt-project.org

To install Trident, please make sure yt is installed first.  Then download the
Trident repository at: http://bitbucket.org/trident-project/trident .  If you
have mercurial installed, you can do this with:

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/trident-project/trident

In addition, you will need a data file for running Trident.  Get the 
following file and put it in the trident/data/ion_balance/ 
directory:

$ wget http://chummels.org/trident/cloudy_ion_balance.h5 <path/to/trident/repo>/data/ion_balance

Now you should be ready to go.  To test your installation, you can go into
the sample directory and run the working_example.py file.  You will require
the enzo_cosmology_plus yt public dataset in order for this example to work.
To get it and test it, run:

$ wget http://yt-project.org/data/enzo_cosmology_plus.tar.gz .
$ tar -zxvf enzo_cosmology_plus.tar.gz
$ cp <path/to/trident/repo>/sample/working_example.py enzo_cosmology_plus
$ cd enzo_cosmology_plus
$ python working_example.py
