Trident is a python-based package extending yt for generating synthetic
absorption-line spectra of hydrodynamical datasets.

Please visit the Trident and yt websites and their respective documentation
for more information:

To install Trident, please assure yt is installed (right now it only works on 
the tip of the yt development branch, not with the stable version).  Download 
the Trident repository at: http://bitbucket.org/trident-project/trident .  
With mercurial installed, you can do this by:

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/trident-project/trident

$ cd trident

$ python setup.py develop


In addition, you will need a data file for running Trident.  Get 
one of the following files and put it in the trident/data/ion_balance/ 
directory.  The best results are achieved using the high-resolution data 
file (1.6GB), but the low-resolution data is also acceptable (205MB).

High-Res (1.6GB)

$ cd <path/to/trident/repo>/data/ion_balance

$ wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_hr.h5 

Low-Res (205MB)

$ wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_lr.h5


Now you should be ready to go.  To test your installation, you can run our
working script.  You will require the enzo_cosmology_plus yt public dataset 
in order for this example to work.  To get it and test it, exit the trident
source directory into a test working directory and run the following:

$ cd <sandbox/directory>

$ wget http://yt-project.org/data/enzo_cosmology_plus.tar.gz 

$ tar -zxvf enzo_cosmology_plus.tar.gz

$ cp <path/to/trident/repo>/examples/working_script.py .

$ python working_script.py
